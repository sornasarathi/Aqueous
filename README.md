## The Tono_LITE 
This is a portable, cost-effective, non-contact device for at-home intraocular pressure (IOP)
measurement in glaucoma patients, addressing the limitations of traditional high-cost, contact-based tools.
It uses an air puff unit with a pump, regulator, solenoid valve, and nozzle to generate and control air
pressure for corneal applanation, ranging from 600 mmHg to 50 mmHg, guided by Bernoulli’s principle. An
880 nm IR emitter and a photodiode (sensitive to 700-1100 nm) detect corneal flattening, with the
photodiode’s nanosecond response capturing fine changes. The ESP32 microcontroller manages the air puff
and processes IR data, supporting IoT-based remote patient monitoring. Results are displayed on an OLED
screen, and data is transmitted securely to a cloud platform. The device employs an advanced tonometry
algorithm, correcting for corneal hysteresis and central corneal thickness (CCT) to ensure accurate readings,
even after corneal surgeries. Weighing 750g and built with ISO-certified medical components, the TonoLITE
offers a user-friendly, precise, and reliable tool for proactive glaucoma management at home.
